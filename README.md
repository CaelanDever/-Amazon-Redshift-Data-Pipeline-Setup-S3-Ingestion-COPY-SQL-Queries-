⚡️ 30-Second Project Summary
-
📊 Amazon Redshift Data Pipeline Setup (S3 Ingestion, COPY, SQL Queries)
-
In today's data-driven world, building scalable cloud data pipelines is crucial for roles like Data Engineers, Cloud SysAdmins, and Analytics Engineers. Amazon Redshift powers large-scale analytics workloads by consolidating data into a high-performance cloud data warehouse.
In this project, you’ll simulate setting up a pipeline where raw data lands in Amazon S3 and gets ingested into Redshift for analysis. You'll practice creating AWS storage, database ingestion, writing SQL, and understanding core differences between Redshift and PostgreSQL systems.

Key Skills You’ll Learn:
-
🗂 Create & Upload Data to Amazon S3 (Cloud Storage Basics)

🏗 Launch and Configure an Amazon Redshift Cluster (Cloud Infrastructure Setup)

🛠 Load Data into Redshift using COPY Command (Data Ingestion Techniques)

🧠 Write SQL for Data Validation and Analytics (Data Engineering Core Skill)

🔒 Use IAM Roles for Secure Resource Access (Cloud Security Best Practices)

How This Project Fits Into Broader Technical Knowledge:
-
This project fits into Cloud Data Engineering Pipelines learning path. It mirrors real-world ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipelines used in companies moving from traditional database environments to cloud-native analytics platforms. You’ll touch AWS services, SQL, security roles, and system design fundamentals — which are foundational for progressing into Data Engineering, SysAdmin II, or DevOps roles.

# 1. Prepare Sample Data and S3 Bucket (Beginner Level)
WHAT to do:
Create a sample CSV file.

Upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket.

HOW to do it:
Create a CSV file locally:

echo "user_id,timestamp,page,action
101,2025-04-16 10:00:00,Home,View
102,2025-04-16 10:00:05,Product,View
101,2025-04-16 10:01:00,Product,Click" > clickstream_2025-04-16.csv
Create an S3 bucket (use a unique name globally):

aws s3 mb s3://my-clickstream-bucket
Upload the CSV file to the bucket:

aws s3 cp clickstream_2025-04-16.csv s3://my-clickstream-bucket/
WHY this step:
S3 is used as a data lake — a centralized cloud storage where raw data is staged before processing.

Real-world job scenario:
In a real project, your system would upload user activity, logs, or transactional data into S3.

📸 Take Screenshot: After uploading the file, capture your AWS Console showing the file in S3.

🛠 Troubleshooting Tips:
-
Ensure your AWS CLI is configured (aws configure).

Bucket name must be globally unique.

S3 permissions must allow your IAM user to upload objects.

# 2. Launch a Redshift Cluster (Intermediate Level)
WHAT to do:
Launch a small Redshift cluster for loading and querying the data.

HOW to do it:
In AWS Console > Redshift > Create Cluster.

Choose dc2.large single-node (eligible for free-tier).

Set a master username and password.

Enable Public Access (for easier testing).

Create or select a security group allowing access from your IP.

WHY this step:
Redshift is a cloud data warehouse optimized for running complex analytical SQL queries on large datasets.

Real-world job scenario:
You set up clusters for analysts to run reports, dashboards, or machine learning preprocessing.

📸 Take Screenshot: Cluster status showing "available" with endpoint details.

<img width="548" alt="redcluster" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98fce0c9-3760-497b-9472-facec4b85b29" />


🛠 Troubleshooting Tips:
-

If stuck in "creating," check VPC settings and ensure subnet group exists.

Make sure public accessibility is "Yes" if connecting from your laptop.

# 3. Create IAM Role for Redshift S3 Access (Security Focus)

WHAT to do:
Create an IAM role allowing Redshift to read from S3.

HOW to do it:
In AWS Console > IAM > Roles > Create role.

Service: Choose Redshift.

Attach policy: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.

Name the role (e.g., MyRedshiftS3Role).

Attach this IAM role to your Redshift cluster.

WHY this step:
Securely authorizes Redshift to access S3 without embedding credentials.

Real-world job scenario:
Using IAM roles aligns with cloud security best practices — avoid hardcoded access keys.

📸 Take Screenshot: IAM Role summary page showing permissions.

🛠 Troubleshooting Tips:
-

Make sure you choose Redshift as trusted service.

Confirm role is attached to the cluster after creation.

# 4. Create a Table in Redshift (SQL Foundations)

WHAT to do:
Connect to Redshift using psql or any SQL client and create the table.

HOW to do it:

psql -h redshift-cluster-endpoint -p 5439 -U masteruser -d dev

Then run:

CREATE TABLE clickstream (
    user_id INT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    page VARCHAR(50),
    action VARCHAR(20)
);
WHY this step:
Defines how Redshift will structure and store the data internally.

Real-world job scenario:
Data Engineers must design schemas optimized for querying and reporting.

📸 Take Screenshot: psql showing successful table creation.

🛠 Troubleshooting Tips:
-

Check if Security Group firewall rules allow your public IP.

Use SSL connections if required by your organization.

# 5. Load Data with COPY Command (Data Ingestion Core)

WHAT to do:
Load the file from S3 into Redshift using COPY.

HOW to do it:

COPY clickstream
FROM 's3://my-clickstream-bucket/clickstream_2025-04-16.csv'
IAM_ROLE 'arn:aws:iam::your-account-id:role/MyRedshiftS3Role'
FORMAT AS CSV
TIMEFORMAT 'auto'
IGNOREHEADER 1;
WHY this step:
COPY leverages parallel processing to ingest data quickly.

Real-world job scenario:
This is the fundamental step for batch pipelines bringing raw data into the warehouse.

📸 Take Screenshot: Successful COPY output showing loaded rows.

🛠 Troubleshooting Tips:
-
Check role ARN and file path spelling.

Check Redshift logs (STL_LOAD_ERRORS) if there’s any COPY failure.

# 6. Query and Analyze Data (SQL for Analytics)

WHAT to do:

Write SQL queries to validate and analyze the data.

HOW to do it:

Example queries:


SELECT action, COUNT(*) FROM clickstream GROUP BY action;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM clickstream WHERE page = 'Product' AND action = 'View';
WHY this step:
Validates data load and prepares it for business reporting.

Real-world job scenario:
Analysts and BI tools query Redshift daily to create dashboards, reports, or train ML models.

📸 Take Screenshot: Query output showing counts/grouping.

<img width="419" alt="querries" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c24065a6-6835-4a56-a40d-cb30181097b7" />


🛠 Troubleshooting Tips:
-

If queries are slow, check table design (distribution/sort keys optimization for large data).

# 7. Clean Up Resources (Cost Control)

WHAT to do:
Delete created resources to avoid unnecessary AWS charges.

HOW to do it:

aws redshift delete-cluster --cluster-identifier your-cluster-name --skip-final-cluster-snapshot
aws s3 rb s3://my-clickstream-bucket --force
WHY this step:
AWS services bill hourly — always clean up test environments!

📸 Take Screenshot: AWS console showing no clusters or buckets left.
